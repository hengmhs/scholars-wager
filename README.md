# Scholar's Wager

## About

This language-learning app was built as the Frontend Project 1 for the Rocket Academy Bootcamp.

Scholar's Wager is a 2-player game that makes learning Chinese vocabulary more fun for English-speaking players by implementing competitive wagering elements. Played over 10 rounds, the winner is the player who has the most points at the end of the game.

Words that you encounter while playing the game are saved so that you can review them again later.

This app was primarily created with React and CSS.
